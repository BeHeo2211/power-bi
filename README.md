![PEW Retail Dashboard](images/155ca486-0c09-4272-b427-607326209c41.jfif)

## **Problem Statement**
PEW Retail Inc. Ltd. has subsidiaries across the globe, selling products to various customers scattered across different geographies. They aim to create a consolidated dashboard to meet the following requirements:

1. How much tax is paid based on the various regions they do business in.
2. The number of orders received by various product categories.
3. Identify the top five customers consuming their products.
4. Orders received by various regions across product categories and products.
5. Ensure any changes or additions to the sales data automatically reflect on the dashboard without manual intervention.

## **Dataset: CSV File Names and Descriptions**

1. **DimCustomer**  
   - **Description**: Contains detailed information about customers, such as customer IDs, names, contact details, and demographics.

2. **DimGeography**  
   - **Description**: Includes geographical data such as regions, countries, cities, and postal codes.

3. **DimProduct**  
   - **Description**: Contains product details, including product IDs, names, descriptions, and other related attributes.

4. **DimProductCategory**  
   - **Description**: Categorizes products into broader categories like electronics, clothing, etc.

5. **DimProductSubCategory**  
   - **Description**: Provides details of subcategories under each product category for granular analysis.

6. **FactInternetSales**  
   - **Description**: Fact table containing sales data, including transaction details, quantities, revenues, and other metrics for internet sales.

## **Relationship Setup**
Before proceeding, ensure all relationships between tables are established. One missing relationship is:  
- **Create a relationship between** `ProductSubCategoryKey` in **DimProductSubCategory** and **DimProduct**.

## **Steps to Build the Dashboard**

### 1. Tax Paid by Different Countries
- **Quick Measure**:  
  Create a new measure in `FactInternetSales`:
  ```DAX
  Total Tax = SUM(FactInternetSales[TaxAmt])
## Tax Amount by Different Countries
Now this shows tax amount by different countries.
After that, I am going to use a bubble map to create a visualization, and in this map, under the location section, I will place `EnglishCountryRegionname`.

---

## Number of Orders Received by Different Product Categories
To show this information, we can use a clustered column chart:
- Drop the `EnglishProductCategory` into the **x-axis**.
- For the **y-axis**, I need to add a measurable value or a fact value. For that, I add the `SalesOrderNumber` to the **y-axis** and change it to **distinct count** since we may have multiple orders for a single product.

---

## Finding the Top Five Customers by Sales Amount
- First, we should check whether we have a `SalesAmount` column or not:
  - Luckily, we do, but in case we don't, we should create a quick measure for sale amount.

- To visualize the top 5 customers, I choose a **Tree Map**:
  - First, drop `CustomerName` into the tree map and add `SalesAmount`.
  - However, it initially shows all the customers we have, so we need to filter it:
    - Go to the filter bar, set a filter on `CustomerName`.
    - Configure it to display only the **top 5 customers** based on their `SalesAmount`.

## Next, I want to determine which product category has the highest number of orders, right? 
- A bar chart is the best way to easily understand this data.
- Now, I want to compare this information with countries. To do this, I add EnglishCountryName to the x-axis and create a measure for the number of orders using the distinct count of OrderSales. This will provide a clear comparison of product orders across different countries

![PEW Retail Dashboard](images/Picture3.png)

But let's say now I want to find out which product category has the maximum orders in the United States. For example, it shows that there are 9.6K ordersâ€”over 9,000 orders. To analyze this further, we need to see the breakdown of these orders by category.

To achieve this, under the data field, we need to add product category name below the x-axis to enable the drill-down functionality. I add English product category to the x-axis, allowing us to drill down into the data and see which product category contributes the most orders in the United States.

## Total Sales Amount by Categories for Each Country

I want to find for each country what is the total sales amount by categories. I choose matrix table. Add country name in rows and I got all coutries. Category in the columns. And I create total sale measure: 
```DAX
total sale = SUM(FactInternetSales[SalesAmount])
Add it into values.

### **Preparing the Data**
![Dataset Preparation](images/Capture2.PNG)

- **Rename Column**: Renamed the `Date` column to `Date_Purchased` in Power Query Editor for better clarity.  
- **Filter Out Milk**: Removed rows where `Product Name` equals "Milk" as it is not relevant in an apocalyptic scenario.  
- **Remove Null Values**: Eliminated null values from the `Apocalypse Food Prep Overview` column to ensure data quality.  
- **Change Data Types**: Corrected the data types for all columns to match their intended formats (e.g., dates, numbers, and text).  
- **Unpivot Column**: Restructured the dataset by unpivoting the `Date` column for analysis readiness.  
- **Create Relationships**: Established relationships between the `Sales`, `Products`, and `Customers` tables to enable accurate data modeling and analysis.

### **DAX Measures**

- **Count of Sales**:  
  Calculated the total number of sales to track transaction volume using the `COUNT` function.  

- **Sum of Products Sold**:  
  Summed up the total quantity of products sold to analyze product performance using the `SUM` function.  

- **Total Profit**:  
  Computed total profit by aggregating the profit for all products, using the `SUMX` function for row-by-row calculations.
- **Day of Week:**
  Added a calculated column to determine the day of the week for each transaction using the `WEEKDAY` function:
